** Self-Introduction
- Name
- Website/Twitter/Github
** Introduction
- No flames/editor wars
I'm not trying to convince anyone to use Emacs, but I'd like to share some concepts that might be interesting/useful.
- Documentation
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Vim/Emacs comparison
- Why Emacs is right /for me/...
*** Typical Criticisms
- Too big/Memory Hog
  - Hi. It's 2015.
- Keyboard shortcuts terrible
  - Maybe not as bad as you think
    - Logical and fast when you learn them
    - RSI? Show me even one reliable study...
  - Don't like them? Change them!
- Does more than an editor should/Doesn't follow 'Unix Way'
  + Emacs isn't just an editor. It's a Lisp evaluation system, with buffers that interact with the underlying OS.
  + So? Don't use the extra features. (Who said the 'Unix Way' was infallible?)
  + So does my smartphone... :)
** Terminology/Key Concepts

** Stupid Ruby Tricks
