# KCRuby Emacs Demo

This is an [outline/cheatsheet](https://github.com/XiaoA/kc_ruby_emacs_demo/blob/master/emacs-ruby-presentation.org) of topics for an introductory demonstration on Emacs, for the [KC Ruby Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/kcruby/).

I created in Emacs, with [Org-Mode](http://orgmode.org). In the future, I might expand upon these topics with blog posts and/or screencast demonstrations. If you have any questions about Emacs, please contact me.

## Check it out!
The outline is here: <https://github.com/XiaoA/kc_ruby_emacs_demo/blob/master/emacs-ruby-presentation.org>.
